# UCB_CS188_Pacman_Full_Score
My solution for UCB Pacman hw project. (full score. A*, Reinforcement Learning, Inference etc.)

UCB Pacman: http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

Some of the original testcases were not uploaded due to the large file size. If you wanna test the correctness of this work, the most efficient way is to copy the solution file from this project (for instance: search.py) to the matched original project folder(downloaded from the link above), then run the autograder.py

PLZ star this project if it's helpful to you. Enjoy coding! :)

(Editting at Dec. 2020) If you need any help about the understanding of the code, just feel free to contact me or ask in the issues. I'm more than happy to help.
And I think it worths mention that it was when I just started learning python that I took this course and wrote the solution, so there might have been some strange/unefficent code implentations in this work. So I highly recommand you to try your own approach when you think your implementation idea is different from mine.
支持中文答疑，哈哈。有帮助的话点个Star呗~
